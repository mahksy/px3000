## A label template for Behringer Ultrapatch PX3000 patchbays


### ⚠ Please note:

⚠ This is a WIP project that will probably be updated very seldom, if at all.

⚠ This is a little passion project, no guarantee for fitting dimensions!


I highly recommend vinyl cutting these labels, printing could work, especially for a temporary or WIP setup so you can rip it off and make a new one on the fly.

The XLR shell rack cover has been lasercut by me out of 5 mm Plexiglass XT, probably works with anything (Steel?)


This came into life after seeing that multiple software solutions for patchbay labelling were immensly expensive and just plainly stated overpriced for the hobbyist audio fanatic.
After messaging Behringer about a label template and receiving a technical drawing, I started sitting down and drew this, and to this day it is in use on my home patch bay!
The solution was to pull the proper drawing out of the manual PDF file, since PDF is still SVG under the hood.
Thankfully that worked a charm, and after a few hours and a few failed vinyl plotter attempts, a lot of swearing and drawing, here is the public release for my label template!
